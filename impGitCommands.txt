BASIC COMMANDS

GITHUB COMMANDS

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BASIC COMMANDS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	* git config --global --user.name "[username]"	This sets the user name in global config file
	* git config --global --user.email "[email]"	This sets the user email in global config file
 	* git config --global core.editor "code -w"	Sets VSCode as default editor
 	* git status					This shows what files are tracked, modified and needs commit
 	* git add [filename]				Adds the specific file for staging
 	* git add .					Uses the wildcard '.' for adding all files to staging
 	* git commit -m ["message"]			Commits the changes from staging state to final commited stage
 	* git commit -am ["message"]			Shortcut to skip [git add filename] and directly commit
 	* git ls-files					Shows files that are being tracked by git
 	* git log					Shows the log history
 	* git show					Similar to log
 	* git log --oneline				Shows one line entry for commits

 THESE BELOW COMMANDS WILL ONLY WORK BEFORE COMMIT. AFTER COMMIT THESE WILL HAVE NO EFFECT.
 	* git restore --staged [filename]		Removes file from staging		
 	* git restore [filename]			Restores file and discards new changes made to file
 OTHER COMMANDS THAT COULD BE USED IN PLACE OF ABOVE ARE: 
 	* git reset HEAD [filename]			Removes file from staging
 	* git checkout -- [filename]			Restores file and discards new changes made to file
 HOWEVER THE GIT_RESTORE_--STAGED AND GIT_RESTORE COMMANDS ARE EASY AND MORE INTUITIVE TO USE

 	* git mv [fileOld] [fileNew]
 	* git config --global alias.hist "log --oneline --graph --decorate --all"			creates alias
 	* git config --global -e			Opens the global config file for modification
 	
	IF ANY MODIFICATION IS MADE OUT OF THE GIT, EXAMPLE IF MV RM IS USED AND NOT GIT RM, GIT MV THEN
 	USE THE [GIT ADD -A] CAPITAL A NOT -a. THIS WILL FIX ALL THE PROBLEMS AND ADD CORRECT FILES FOR STAGING

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADVANCED COMMANDS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	* git checkout -b [branchname]			Creates a new branch with branchname and checkout to it. 
	* git branch					Shows the branches
	* git checkout [branchname]			Checkouts to a new branch ie. changes from one to another branch
	* git merge [branchname]			Merges branchname to current active branch
	* git branch -d [branchname]			Deletes the branch with branchname

 GIT HAS TWO TYPES OF TAGS --ANOTATED--&--SIMPLE--
	* git tag [tagname]				Is a lightweight tag
	* git tag -a [tagname] -m ["commit notes"]	Is an anotated tag that contains extra information

 GIT HAS THREE TYPES OF RESET MODES --SOFT--MIXED--HARD--
	SOFT::  Only head is changed
	MIXED:: Head and index both changes
	HARD::  Head, index and the files in working directory all changes
	-- A good explanation is given an stack overflow
	-- What is Index? When we do [git add .] the files in '.' are added to Index to be commited
	   only the files in the index are commited to repo.
	-- So a soft reset does not effect the INDEX but only the HEAD
	-- So a mixedreset does not effect the FILES in WORKING DIRECTORY but only the INDEX and HEAD
	-- So a hard reset will effect everything INDEX, HEAD & WORKING DIRECTORY 
	 

NOTE: While merging there could be 3 scenaros --1-- Fast Merge --2-- Auto Merge (No Conflict) --3-- Manual Merge (Conflict)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GITHUB COMMANDS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	* git remote -v					Shows the status of the remote
	* git remote add origin [link to repo on github]Adds the current repo to GH with the name as "origin"
	* git push -u origin master --tags		Pushes changes to GH origin -> master including tags, sets tracking
	* git push origin master			Pushes the changes to GH origin tracking not needed as done already
	* git push -u origin [name of the branch to be pushed to github]
		The above command could be used to push newly created branch to github and setup a tracking relationship
		with it.
	
 GIT PULL ARE TWO COMMANDS IN ONE, IT COMBINES GIT FETCH AND GIT MERGE. AS THERE COULD BE CONFLICTS WHILE MERGING SO WE CAN
 USE GIT FETCH TO BE SAFE AS GIT FETCH COMMAND IS NON DESTRUCTIVE.
	* git fetch					Fetches the changes from GH
	* git pull					Fetches the changes and merges the changes with our local copy

 It is always a good practise to always perform pull before push
	* git remote set-url origin [new url if changed]If any change is made to the remote then update its url using this
	* git push --set-upstream origin [branchName]	Sets an upstream tracking with origin and branchNAME
	* git pull --all				Will pull all tracking branches irrespective of branch we are on
	* git push --all				Same as above but this time for pushing the changes
	* git push :[branchName]			Deletes the branch from remote i.e. GitHub
	* git fetch -p (p for prune)			Deletes branch references from local that were deleted from remote
							After deleting any branch on the GITHUB run this command on the 
							local machine terminal to delete the same brach on the local repo.
							NOTE: If we delete a branch on GH and run fetch/pull on local this
							      would not delete the branch on the local machine. We have to
							      run the above command to prune the branch.

 PULLING WITH  REBASE ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 If you remember what rebase actually does, it rewinds the current commits that are on your branch to
 a point to where the branch you're merging in originally diverged then playing back the commits that
 happened on the branch that you're wanting to bring in; and then, after that, playing on top of that 
 any commits that have happened on the branch that you're currently on, thus making any changes that 
 you have include the changes that happened on the remote branch, but with your changes made ahead of 
 them. This is a good strategy when you're working on something, and you want to make sure that your 
 changes are ahead of whatever's going on from the remote side.
	* git pull --rebase				Causes whatever is explained above
	*
